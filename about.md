I'm a software developer passionate about **games** and **game engines**.

I have experience in:
- Real-time 3D graphics with OpenGL and Vulkan
- AI systems and pathfinding
- Unity programming
- Network programming
- Tools programming
- Mobile programming
- Game engine architecture and optimization
- Building cross-platform tools and C++ libraries
- DevOps and cloud setup/architecture
- GitHub actions.
- Systems design
- C++, C# and other languages

When I’m not coding, I play classic PC games, work on my latest game and/or my engine, workout, and of course spend time with my family ♥️
