I'm a software developer passionate about **game engines**, **AI**, and **digital tools**.  
I build low-level systems, create custom game engines, and design tools that empower developers and creatives.

I have experience in:
- Real-time 3D graphics with OpenGL and Vulkan
- AI systems and pathfinding
- Unity programming
- Network programming
- Tools programming
- Game engine architecture and optimization
- Building cross-platform tools and C++ libraries
- Systems design
- C++, C# and other languages

When Iâ€™m not coding, I explore classic PC game design, prototype new gameplay mechanics, workout, and occasionally write about technical topics.
